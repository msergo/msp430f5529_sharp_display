msp430f5529 sharp display example
=================================

Sharp Memory LCD booster pack code that runs on the MSP430F5529 launchpad. Ported from other example projects for alternate MSP430 development kits.

Only includes code for the display. Does not use the capacitive touch sliders yet.

Code edited and debugged using VS Code + MSP GCC.
